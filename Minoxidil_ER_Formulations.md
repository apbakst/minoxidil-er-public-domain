# Alternative Extended-Release Minoxidil Formulations

## Patent Design-Around Strategy for Veradermics' HPMC Matrix Claims

**Prepared:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Competitive product development - formulations designed to avoid Veradermics patent WO2024091572A1 / US12268688B2

## Executive Summary

Veradermics' patent claims specifically cover HPMC-based (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) matrix tablets for extended-release oral minoxidil. This document presents **five alternative formulation approaches** using fundamentally different release mechanisms that are likely outside their patent claims:

1. **Elementary Osmotic Pump (EOP)** - Osmotic pressure-driven release
2. **Controlled Porosity Osmotic Pump (CPOP)** - Porous membrane osmotic system
3. **Multi-Particulate Pellet System (MUPS)** - Ethylcellulose-coated pellets in capsule
4. **Lipid Matrix Tablet** - Glyceryl behenate/palmitostearate matrix
5. **Bi-Layer Push-Pull Osmotic Tablet** - Two-compartment mechanical pump

## Development Considerations

### Bioequivalence Strategy
- Different release mechanisms may yield different PK profiles
- May need to target similar AUC rather than identical Cmax/Tmax
- Consider 505(b)(2) pathway if not bioequivalent to Veradermics product

### Stability Studies Required
- Accelerated stability (40°C/75% RH, 6 months)
- Long-term stability (25°C/60% RH, 12-36 months)
- Photostability (ICH Q1B)
- Minoxidil compatibility with each matrix type

### Scale-Up Considerations
- MUPS: Wurster coating equipment availability
- Lipid matrix: Melt granulation or HME equipment
- Osmotic systems: Laser drilling equipment, membrane coating expertise

### Regulatory Pathway Options
1. **505(b)(2)** - Reference Veradermics' safety/efficacy data, own PK studies
2. **505(j) ANDA** - If bioequivalent, but need to design around patents
3. **New NDA** - If claiming superiority or different indication

---

## Important Caveats

1. **Patent freedom-to-operate analysis required** - Have IP attorney review all formulations against full Veradermics claim set
2. **Formulation optimization needed** - These are starting points requiring systematic development
3. **In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC)** - Establish relationship between dissolution and absorption
4. **Clinical PK studies** - Required to confirm target profile achieved
5. **CMC development** - Full pharmaceutical development and validation required
