## Patent Design-Around Strategy for Veradermics' HPMC Matrix Claims

**Prepared:** February 2026
**Updated:** February 5, 2026 (8.5mg dose formulations)
**Purpose:** Competitive product development - formulations designed to avoid Veradermics patent WO2024091572A1 / US12268688B2

## Executive Summary

Veradermics' patent claims specifically cover HPMC-based (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) matrix tablets for extended-release oral minoxidil. This document presents **five alternative formulation approaches** using fundamentally different release mechanisms that are likely outside their patent claims:

1. **Elementary Osmotic Pump (EOP)** - Osmotic pressure-driven release
2. **Controlled Porosity Osmotic Pump (CPOP)** - Porous membrane osmotic system
3. **Multi-Particulate Pellet System (MUPS)** - Ethylcellulose-coated pellets in capsule
4. **Lipid Matrix Tablet** - Glyceryl behenate/palmitostearate matrix
5. **Bi-Layer Push-Pull Osmotic Tablet** - Two-compartment mechanical pump

## Recommended Development Priority

### First Choice: FORMULATION 3 (Multi-Particulate/MUPS)

**Rationale:**
1. **Lowest dose-dumping risk** - critical at 8.5mg where dose-dump could cause cardiac effects
2. Most established regulatory pathway for ER generics
3. No specialized equipment (laser drilling) required
4. Ethylcellulose coatings are well-characterized and approved
5. Flexible release profile customization by adjusting coating level
6. Lower manufacturing complexity than osmotic systems
7. Clear differentiation from HPMC matrix claims

### Second Choice: FORMULATION 4 (Lipid Matrix)

**Rationale:**
1. Simpler manufacturing (melt granulation or hot melt extrusion)
2. Completely different chemistry (lipids vs. polymers)
3. Very strong patent differentiation argument
4. pH-independent release
5. Low-cost, readily available excipients
6. Good stability profile
7. **Caution:** Monitor for food effects in PK studies

### Third Choice: FORMULATION 2 (CPOP)

**Rationale:**
1. Osmotic mechanism clearly different from matrix
2. No laser drilling required (unlike EOP)
3. Zero-order release kinetics
4. Food-independent absorption

---

## Development Considerations

### First-in-Human Study Design (8.5mg dose)

**Recommended approach:**
1. **Dose escalation:** Start with 2.5mg, then 5mg, then 8.5mg
2. **Safety monitoring:** Continuous ECG, BP every 30 min for first 4 hours
3. **PK sampling:** Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24 hours
4. **Food effect arm:** Compare fasted vs. high-fat meal (especially for lipid matrix)

### Bioequivalence Strategy
- Different release mechanisms may yield different PK profiles
- May need to target similar AUC rather than identical Cmax/Tmax
- Consider 505(b)(2) pathway if not bioequivalent to Veradermics product

### Stability Studies Required
- Accelerated stability (40°C/75% RH, 6 months)
- Long-term stability (25°C/60% RH, 12-36 months)
- Photostability (ICH Q1B)
- Minoxidil compatibility with each matrix type

### Scale-Up Considerations
- MUPS: Wurster coating equipment availability
- Lipid matrix: Melt granulation or HME equipment
- Osmotic systems: Laser drilling equipment, membrane coating expertise

### Regulatory Pathway Options
1. **505(b)(2)** - Reference Veradermics' safety/efficacy data, own PK studies
2. **505(j) ANDA** - If bioequivalent, but need to design around patents
3. **New NDA** - If claiming superiority or different indication

---

## Important Caveats

1. **Patent freedom-to-operate analysis required** - Have IP attorney review all formulations against full Veradermics claim set
2. **Formulation optimization needed** - These are starting points requiring systematic development
3. **In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC)** - Establish relationship between dissolution and absorption
4. **Clinical PK studies** - Required to confirm target profile achieved
5. **CMC development** - Full pharmaceutical development and validation required
6. **IND required** - Any human testing requires FDA IND approval
