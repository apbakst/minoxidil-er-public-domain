<h2>VI. Overview of the '688 Patent</h2>

<h3>A. Technology Background</h3>
<p>The '688 patent relates to modified release formulations of minoxidil for treating hair loss. Minoxidil is a well-known drug that has been FDA-approved since 1979 for the treatment of hypertension (marketed as Loniten®) and since 1988 for topical treatment of androgenetic alopecia (marketed as Rogaine®).</p>

<p>The use of oral minoxidil for hair loss treatment was well-established in the medical literature years before the priority date of the '688 patent (October 25, 2022). Multiple clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral minoxidil for treating various forms of alopecia.</p>

<h3>B. Summary of Challenged Claims</h3>
<p>The challenged claims are method claims directed to treating hair loss by orally administering minoxidil formulations that achieve specific pharmacokinetic parameters:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Claim 1:</strong> Method of treating hair loss with 3.5-20 mg minoxidil achieving Cmax of 0.25-20 ng/mL and Tmax of 30-360 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Claim 2:</strong> Adds "release modifier, filler, glidant, lubricant"</li>
    <li><strong>Claim 12:</strong> Release modifier at 50-80% w/w</li>
    <li><strong>Claim 14:</strong> Specific 4.5 mg dose</li>
    <li><strong>Claim 18:</strong> Specific 9 mg dose</li>
    <li><strong>Claim 24:</strong> Daily dose method with same PK parameters</li>
</ul>

<h2>VIII. Claim Construction</h2>

<p>For purposes of this proceeding, Petitioner proposes that the claims be given their plain and ordinary meaning consistent with the specification.</p>

<h3>A. "Modified release pharmaceutical formulation"</h3>
<p>The specification does not provide a limiting definition. Under the broadest reasonable interpretation, this term encompasses any oral formulation that modifies the release of minoxidil compared to a simple immediate-release tablet, including but not limited to extended-release, sustained-release, controlled-release, or delayed-release formulations.</p>

<p><strong>Critically, the claimed PK parameters (Cmax 0.25-20 ng/mL, Tmax 30-360 minutes) are achieved by standard immediate-release minoxidil tablets,</strong> as demonstrated by Fleishaker 1989 and the Loniten FDA label.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <h4>Key PK Context: Therapeutic Window for Oral Minoxidil</h4>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Significance</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cardiac activity threshold</td>
            <td>~20 ng/mL</td>
            <td>Above this level, cardiovascular side effects (tachycardia, hypotension) occur</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hair growth threshold</td>
            <td>~1.62 ng/mL</td>
            <td>Minimum plasma concentration for hair follicle stimulation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>IR minoxidil 5mg Cmax</td>
            <td>~22 ng/mL</td>
            <td>Exceeds cardiac threshold - explains need for lower IR doses in off-label use</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>IR minoxidil 2.5mg Cmax</td>
            <td>~11 ng/mL</td>
            <td>Well within claimed range (0.25-20 ng/mL)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>This demonstrates that the claimed PK range (0.25-20 ng/mL) encompasses the entire therapeutic window for minoxidil, from hair growth threshold to cardiac threshold. Standard IR minoxidil at commonly-prescribed off-label doses (2.5-5mg) already achieves Cmax values within this claimed range.</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>B. "Release modifier"</h3>
<p>The specification describes HPMC K4M and K200M as release modifiers in the examples. However, the claims do not limit the release modifier to any specific excipient. Under the broadest reasonable interpretation, any excipient that modifies drug release qualifies.</p>

<h2>IX. The Challenged Claims Are Unpatentable</h2>

<h3>Ground 1: Claims 1, 2, 14, 18, and 24 Are Anticipated Under § 102</h3>

<p>Claims 1, 2, 14, 18, and 24 are anticipated by the combination of Fleishaker 1989 and the established use of oral minoxidil for hair loss as documented in Sinclair 2018.</p>

<div style="background-color: #e6f4ea; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #34a853; margin: 20px 0;">
    <strong>CONCLUSION - GROUND 1:</strong> Every element of Claim 1 is disclosed in the prior art. Standard immediate-release oral minoxidil, when administered for hair loss as documented in Sinclair 2018 and other pre-priority date publications, inherently achieves the claimed PK parameters as established by Fleishaker 1989. Claim 1 is anticipated.
</div>

<h4>Claims 2, 14, 18, and 24</h4>

<p><strong>Claim 2</strong> adds "a release modifier, a filler, a glidant, a lubricant." Standard pharmaceutical tablets inherently contain these excipients. The Loniten tablets contain standard tableting excipients. ANTICIPATED.</p>

<p><strong>Claim 14</strong> specifies "about 4.5 mg" minoxidil. Fleishaker studied 5.0 mg, which is "about 4.5 mg" under standard claim construction (~10% variation). ANTICIPATED.</p>

<p><strong>Claim 18</strong> specifies "about 9 mg" minoxidil. Fleishaker studied 10.0 mg, which is "about 9 mg" under standard claim construction. ANTICIPATED.</p>

<p><strong>Claim 24</strong> claims a daily dose method with the same PK parameters. The prior art discloses daily administration achieving these parameters. ANTICIPATED.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Ground 2: Claims 1, 2, 12, 14, 18, and 24 Are Obvious Under § 103</h3>

<p>Even if the claims are not anticipated, they are obvious over the combination of Fleishaker 1989, Randolph 2021, and Jimenez-Cauhe 2020.</p>

<h4>A. State of the Art Before Priority Date</h4>

<p>Before October 25, 2022, the following was well-established:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Oral minoxidil PK was known:</strong> Fleishaker 1989 established Cmax ~17 ng/mL and Tmax = 1 hour for standard oral tablets.</li>
    <li><strong>Oral minoxidil for hair loss was known:</strong> Multiple systematic reviews (Randolph 2021, Jimenez-Cauhe 2020, Sharma 2020) documented efficacy in 61-100% of androgenetic alopecia patients.</li>
    <li><strong>Dosing for hair loss was known:</strong> Doses of 0.25-5 mg daily were well-documented for hair loss treatment.</li>
    <li><strong>The method was in clinical use:</strong> Thousands of patients were being treated with off-label oral minoxidil for alopecia.</li>
</ol>

<h4>B. Motivation to Combine</h4>

<p>A person of ordinary skill in the art (POSITA) would have been motivated to administer oral minoxidil for hair loss because:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Multiple peer-reviewed publications documented efficacy and safety</li>
    <li>Oral administration offered advantages over topical (better compliance, no scalp irritation)</li>
    <li>The PK profile of oral minoxidil was well-characterized</li>
    <li>Dermatologists were already prescribing it off-label</li>
</ol>

<h4>C. Reasonable Expectation of Success</h4>

<p>A POSITA would have had a reasonable expectation of success because:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clinical studies showed 61-100% response rates in androgenetic alopecia</li>
    <li>The mechanism of action (vasodilation, potassium channel opening) was understood</li>
    <li>The safety profile at low doses was well-documented</li>
</ol>

<h4>D. Claim 12 - Release Modifier at 50-80% w/w</h4>

<p>Claim 12 requires the release modifier at 50-80% w/w. This is a routine formulation optimization that would have been obvious to a pharmaceutical scientist. The selection of release modifier percentage involves only routine experimentation to achieve a desired release profile. <em>See In re Aller</em>, 220 F.2d 454, 456 (CCPA 1955) (optimization of result-effective variables is obvious).</p>

<div style="background-color: #e6f4ea; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #34a853; margin: 20px 0;">
    <strong>CONCLUSION - GROUND 2:</strong> The combination of known oral minoxidil PK (Fleishaker), documented use for hair loss (Randolph, Jimenez-Cauhe, Sharma), and routine formulation optimization renders all challenged claims obvious.
</div>

<hr>

<h3>Ground 3: Claims Anticipated by Loniten Label and Sharma 2020</h3>

<p>The FDA-approved Loniten label (2015) in combination with Sharma 2020's systematic review anticipates the challenged claims by disclosing:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Oral minoxidil tablets achieving Tmax within 1 hour (60 minutes)</li>
    <li>Use for treating hair loss in thousands of patients</li>
    <li>Doses achieving blood levels within the claimed ranges</li>
</ol>

<h2>X. Secondary Considerations Do Not Overcome Prima Facie Obviousness</h2>

<p>Patent Owner may argue secondary considerations of non-obviousness. However:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>No long-felt need:</strong> Oral minoxidil for hair loss was already in widespread clinical use before the priority date.</li>
    <li><strong>No failure of others:</strong> Others had successfully used oral minoxidil for hair loss, as documented in the prior art.</li>
    <li><strong>No unexpected results:</strong> The claimed PK parameters are the inherent, expected parameters of oral minoxidil administration.</li>
    <li><strong>No commercial success attributable to claimed invention:</strong> Any commercial success is due to minoxidil's known efficacy, not the claimed PK parameters.</li>
</ol>

<h2>XI. Conclusion</h2>

<p>For the reasons set forth above, Petitioner has demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on at least one of the challenged claims. The prior art clearly establishes that:</p>

<ol>
