## SCOPE OF DISCLOSURE

This repository contains complete pharmaceutical formulation specifications for five (5) alternative extended-release oral minoxidil delivery systems:

| Formulation | Mechanism | Primary Excipients |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **1. Elementary Osmotic Pump (EOP)** | Osmotic pressure through laser-drilled orifice | Cellulose acetate membrane, NaCl, PEO |
| **2. Controlled Porosity Osmotic Pump (CPOP)** | Osmotic release through in-situ formed pores | Cellulose acetate, sorbitol pore-former |
| **3. Multi-Particulate System (MUPS)** | Diffusion through polymer-coated pellets | Ethylcellulose, Eudragit RS coatings |
| **4. Lipid Matrix Tablet** | Erosion/diffusion through waxy lipid | Compritol 888 ATO, Precirol ATO 5 |
| **5. Bi-Layer Push-Pull Osmotic** | Mechanical pumping via expanding polymer | Polyethylene oxide, cellulose acetate |

All formulations include:
- Complete quantitative compositions (mg and % w/w)
- Manufacturing process descriptions
- Expected release profiles
- Pharmacokinetic targets

## LEGAL EFFECT

Under the America Invents Act (AIA), **35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)** provides:

## CONTEXT

These formulations were designed as alternatives to Veradermics' HPMC-based matrix technology (Patent WO2024091572A1 / US12268688B2) using fundamentally different release mechanisms:

- **Veradermics claims:** HPMC matrix tablets (K4M, K200M grades) with gel diffusion/erosion
- **These formulations use:** Osmotic pumps, ethylcellulose coatings, lipid matrices - different mechanisms entirely

---

## DISCLAIMER

This is a technical disclosure for prior art purposes. It is not medical advice. These formulations have not been tested in humans and would require full regulatory approval before commercialization.
