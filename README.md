## LEGAL EFFECT

Under the America Invents Act (AIA), **35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)** provides:

> "A person shall be entitled to a patent unless the claimed invention was patented, **described in a printed publication**, or in public use, on sale, or **otherwise available to the public** before the effective filing date of the claimed invention."

This public GitHub repository, along with the Discord post and other archives, constitutes:
- A "printed publication" under patent law
- Material "otherwise available to the public"

**Effect on Third Parties:** Any patent application filed by third parties after February 4, 2026 covering these specific formulations will face this disclosure as prior art and should be rejected or invalidated.

**Effect on Discloser:** Under 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A), the discloser retains a 1-year grace period (until February 4, 2027) during which this disclosure is not prior art against the discloser's own patent applications.

## CONTEXT

These formulations were designed as alternatives to Veradermics' HPMC-based matrix technology (Patent WO2024091572A1 / US12268688B2) using fundamentally different release mechanisms:

- **Veradermics claims:** HPMC matrix tablets (K4M, K200M grades) with gel diffusion/erosion
- **These formulations use:** Osmotic pumps, ethylcellulose coatings, lipid matrices - different mechanisms entirely

## DISCLAIMER

This is a technical disclosure for prior art purposes. It is not medical advice. These formulations have not been tested in humans and would require full regulatory approval before commercialization.
